## Objectives
    Analyze sales data to identify trends and patterns.
    Compare performance across the three locations.
    Provide actionable insights for business growth and customer satisfaction.

## Results and Conclusions
    We observed consistent daily transaction patterns, but with notable variations across
    Locations. The six-month sales trend shows a positive linear growth, but this period is
    too brief to reliably predict long-term trends, lacking considerations for seasonal 
    changes and wider market factors. These insights highlight the importance of adapting
    staffing strategies to the specific needs of each location, focusing on morning staffing
    in Lower Manhattan and Hell's Kitchen, and afternoon coverage in Astoria. While future
    planning should be cautious, using the current sales data as a base and expanding it with
    thorough market analysis can lead to more dynamic and informed business decisions. Our
    research also pinpointed key products that drive sales and customer visits, varying across
    locations and seasons, and identified the most profitable times for each store. We recommend
    customized pricing and staffing approaches to optimize revenue while ensuring competitiveness
    and operational efficiency. Additionally, we found that all three locations are comparably
    successful in terms of overall revenue and growth. We aim to reassess these metrics once
    growth stabilizes to better allocate resources and determine if certain location-specific
    factors are influencing performance, and whether these can be applied across other stores.

## Next Steps
    Our investigation has also brought to light several potential research avenues, such as
    examining customer loyalty, exploring new market opportunities, and leveraging advanced
    technology to improve customer experience and streamline operations. With more time and
    additional data, we are keen to delve into these areas. Future studies will incorporate
    customer feedback and market comparisons to enrich our data and refine our approach.
